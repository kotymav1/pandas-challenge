    "    <li>Unsuprisingly, Math tends to have the lower scores across all schools.</li>\n",
    "    <li>District schools have much higher Total Student counts than Charter schools. Because there is such a big difference, it makes it hard to concretely concluded specific insights when comparing school types. Schools with more students tend to have more budget, but that does not strictly mean that a greater budget results in higher passing rates as explained before.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Math/Reading scores by Grades do not show any meaningful differences between grades. This indicates that there is not a specific grade that is having issues, it is the entire school.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Larger schools have a much lower overall passing rate, this is likely due to a number of issues beyond this dataset such as income, but we can assume that students in larger schools may get less one-on-one attention which leads to lower scores.</li>\n",
